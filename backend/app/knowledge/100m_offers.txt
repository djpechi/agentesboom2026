ALEX HORMOZI - $100M OFFERS FRAMEWORK SUMMARY

CORE CONCEPT: VALUE EQUATION
Value = (Dream Outcome x Perceived Likelihood of Achievement) / (Time Delay x Effort & Sacrifice)

1. Dream Outcome (Increase)
- What is the final destination the customer wants to reach?
- How will their status increase?

2. Perceived Likelihood of Achievement (Increase)
- How confident are they that THEY will achieve the result with YOUR method?
- Proof: Case studies, testimonials, guarantees.
- "It has worked for people just like me."

3. Time Delay (Decrease)

- If the main result takes time, what immediate payoff can you give?

4. Effort & Sacrifice (Decrease)
- What hard things do they have to do? (Sacrifice)
- How unpleasant is the process? (Effort)
- "Done For You" is better than "Do It Yourself".
