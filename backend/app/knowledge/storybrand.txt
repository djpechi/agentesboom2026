DONALD MILLER - STORYBRAND (SB7) SUMMARY

THE SB7 FRAMEWORK
Every great story (and brand message) follows this 7-part framework:

1. A CHARACTER
- The customer is the hero, not your brand.
- Identify what they want (External problem) and why it matters (Internal problem).

2. HAS A PROBLEM
- External: The physical problem (e.g., "I need a website").
- Internal: How it makes them feel (e.g., "I feel overwhelmed and invisible").
- Philosophical: Why it's wrong (e.g., "It shouldn't be this hard to get online").
- The Villain: The root cause (e.g., "Complexity").

3. AND MEETS A GUIDE
- Your brand is the Guide (Yoda), not the Hero (Luke).
- The Guide must demonstrate:
  - Empathy: "I understand how you feel."
  - Authority: "I have helped others solve this." (Testimonials, logos, stats).

4. WHO GIVES THEM A PLAN
- Clarify the path to success to reduce anxiety.
- Process Plan: Step 1, Step 2, Step 3. (e.g., Schedule a Call -> We Build Strategy -> You Grow).
- Agreement Plan: What we agree to do (reduces fear).

5. AND CALLS THEM TO ACTION
- Customers don't take action unless challenged.
- Direct CTA: "Buy Now", "Schedule Call".
- Transitional CTA: "Download PDF" (for those not ready).

6. THAT HELPS THEM AVOID FAILURE
- What happens if they DON'T buy?
- Identify the stakes (e.g., "Continue losing leads", "Stay invisible").

7. AND ENDS IN SUCCESS
- Show them the "Promised Land".
- What does life look like after the problem is solved?
- Visuals of happy people using the product.

ONE-LINER
- Problem + Solution + Result.
- "We help [Character] who struggles with [Problem] to achieve [Success] by [Plan]."
